"""
The worker's stdout carries its answers and nothing else.

The server reads one JSON reply per line from it. The pipeline runs models on
threads of their own, and two of them swapping `sys.stdout` at once
(`contextlib.redirect_stdout`) once left it pointing at a throwaway buffer:
every reply after that was written into the buffer, and the server waited ten
minutes for analyses that had finished. These pin down that nothing a library
does to stdout can reach the answers again.
