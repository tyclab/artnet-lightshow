"""
Regression tests against analyses of real tracks.

Synthetic signals prove the DSP is correct; they cannot prove the *judgement*
on top of it is sensible, because a synthetic track has no genre, its sections
are identical loops, and its arrangement is whatever the generator wrote. Every
defect in this file was found by running five real tracks through the finished
pipeline and reading the result.

The fixtures in tests/fixtures/tracks/ are the show-facing parts of those
analyses — sections, drops, mood, subgenre scores — with the frame-level curves
stripped. Small enough to read in a diff, and enough to pin the two decisions
that were wrong.
