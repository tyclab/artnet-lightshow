# Audit & improvement roadmap

*Historical audit, September 2026, baseline `4f2191d`. Retained for design
rationale; its findings and open items do not describe the current release.
Use the [README](../README.md) for supported behaviour and current operations.*

## Context

This document audits the whole project — the Node server and render engine, the show director, the Python
analysis pipeline, and the web UI — and lays out a roadmap for optimisation, a smarter show, better UI/UX and
bug fixes. It also records which current tools are worth adopting and why. Earlier design decisions are
treated as open for change.

The rig and use this plan is written for:

- **Rig:** RGBW(A/UV) pars and Philips Hue, **plus LED bars / pixel strips**.
- **Music:** **Spotify on the Windows show PC** (the hybrid Spotify + SMTC clock) **and DJs on CDJs/rekordbox**
  (PRO DJ LINK).
- **Live input:** **hybrid** — pre-analysis when the track is known, with a live input that phase-locks the beat
  and takes over when there is nothing to pre-analyse.
- **Scope:** a bold rewrite is acceptable, delivered as a phased roadmap rather than one change.

**Baseline at the time of the audit:** `npm ci` clean, `npm run lint` clean, `npm test` **620/620**,
`npm run build:client` fine (134 KB), `npm audit --omit=dev` 0 vulnerabilities. The code is careful — rationale
comments, validated stores with atomic writes, engine/preview maths shared behind a parity test. What holds it
back is structural: security gaps on the default setup, external APIs that changed underneath it, a beat
clock that never locks to the music, a one-colour-per-fixture model that cannot express pixels, and a UI that
re-renders everything on every push.

Legend: **[V]** = confirmed by reading the code during this audit. Unmarked items were found by a file-by-file survey and carry a file:line; each is re-checked when it is fixed. Line numbers refer to commit `4f2191d`.

---

## Part A — Audit findings (ranked)

### A1. Security (High)
Several issues were found in the HTTP/Socket.IO boundary and in settings validation that matter on the default
loopback setup, not only on a LAN bind. **Details are deliberately not published in this public repository until
they are fixed**; they are tracked privately and are the first item of Phase 0. Lower-severity hardening items
(input validation on uploads and imports, HTML escaping, unbounded in-memory maps) are folded into the same work.

### A2. Broken by external changes (High)
5. **[V] Spotify February 2026 dev-mode migration** (applied to existing apps 9 March 2026):
   - **ISRC may be missing.** The guide lists `external_ids` as removed from the Track object for development-mode apps; where that applies, `isrc` is null (`src/spotify.js:111,318,344`), the exact-audio Deezer path is skipped, and the track falls back to a yt-dlp *search*, which risks the wrong edit and therefore a wrong timeline. In practice Spotify still sends it to at least some apps, so the fix keeps it when present and looks one up only when it is not.
   - **Playlists moved.** `GET /playlists/{id}/tracks` became `/items`, `tracks.total` became `items.total`, and `items[].track` became `items[].item` (`spotify.js:100,372-411`). Playlists the user doesn't own or collaborate on now return no items.
6. **[V] yt-dlp needs a JavaScript runtime for YouTube** since 2025.11.12. `_ytDlpExec` (`auto-show.js:480`) passes no `--js-runtimes`, and preflight doesn't check for one. Node itself is a supported runtime.

### A3. Musical timing & sync (High — the biggest "smarter show" lever)
7. **[V] The pattern step clock free-runs.**
   - `restartBeatTimer` (`engine.js:348`) builds a `setTimeout` grid from whenever a patch arrived. Scenes re-anchor it, but it drifts between them.
   - **BPM is forced to an integer** in four places: `validation.js:47`, `clampBpm` in `show/render.js` and `director.js`, and `integrations.js:214`. A 123.7 BPM track runs at 124, about 75 ms of drift every 16 bars.
   - The analysed `beats[]`/`downbeats[]` and CDJ beat packets never step patterns.
8. **[V] Events are dispatched by polling:** a 20 ms tick (`auto-show.js:619`) plus a 25 ms render, so cues land 0–45 ms late with jitter. The sync offset fixes only the average.
9. **[V] Only the hybrid source uses the monotonic `PlaybackClock`.**
   - Spotify-only, Deezer and SMTC re-anchor raw (`integrations.js:66`). A backward jump over 100 ms → `_reseek` → `applyPatch({pattern})` → `_step = 0`, so the chase visibly restarts.
   - The hybrid source resets its clock to **0 ms** whenever the OS session stops matching (`hybrid-source.js:220` → `playback-clock.js:101`).
10. **[V] CDJ position sawtooth** (`prolink.js:407-410`).
    - The beat anchor time is reset on *every status packet*, not on each new beat, so the position keeps snapping back and reseeks constantly.
    - The extrapolation is not scaled by pitch, uses `Date.now()`, and judges staleness from any device, not the master.
11. **PRO DJ LINK wastes the data it could have.**
    - Audio comes from a yt-dlp *search*, which often returns the radio edit when the DJ plays the extended mix.
    - The exact file (over NFS), the rekordbox beat grid and **phrase analysis (PSSI)** go unused.
    - Only the master deck is followed.
    - `prolink-connect` hasn't been released since October 2022; its maintained fork is **`alphatheta-connect`**.

### A4. Robustness & performance (High/Medium)
12. **[V] No process-level safety net.**
    - There are no `uncaughtException`/`unhandledRejection` handlers.
    - The render, tick and broadcast timers aren't wrapped in try/catch.
    - Any throw kills the server with the fixtures latched on their last frame.
13. **[V] Analyzer worker bridge.**
    - **Restart race:** the single `_recycling` boolean and an exit handler that ignores which process exited mean fast track skips orphan a GPU-holding Python process and reject the whole queue (`analyzer-worker.js:275,340`).
    - **No stdin `error` listener** (`:444`), so an EPIPE crashes Node.
    - **NaN hangs a request for 600 s:** a line that doesn't parse is ignored until the timeout, and `embeddings`/S-KEY are added *after* `json_safe` (`pipeline.py:158-189`).
14. **[V] Concurrent prefetches can collide.** Temp names are `auto-dl-${Date.now()}` (`auto-show.js:470`) and the Spotify prefetch loop starts several in one tick (`integrations.js:357`). Only the time it takes to spawn yt-dlp keeps them in different milliseconds; two that do share one overwrite each other, and the wrong audio is cached under another track's key.
15. **[V] Main-thread stalls in the process that renders DMX:**
    - `GET /api/auto/cache` parses every cached analysis synchronously (`analysis-cache.js:115`).
    - `GET /api/preflight` runs the model download with `spawnSync` (`preflight.js:519`).
    - `python-env` probes with 30 s `spawnSync`.
    - Every sync-offset nudge rewrites `settings.json`.
    - The analysis cache also writes in place (not atomic), has no eviction, and its key ignores the separator and model settings.
16. **Other correctness bugs:**
    - PRO DJ LINK cache keys collide across USB sticks (`analysis-cache.js:186`).
    - A changed Deezer ARL is ignored until restart (`deezer.js:25`).
    - The show restore moves fixtures to the stored universe at boot (`show-store.js:143` vs `server.js:111`).
    - A Hue pair to an IPv6 or `host:port` address loses the issued key (`routes.js:1062`).
    - Cue and MIDI-map saves mutate memory before the write that can fail.
    - Spotify token refresh isn't single-flight.
17. **Output quality:**
    - **[V]** `dimmerFine` is always 0, so 16-bit dimming is wasted.
    - **[V]** The Art-Net sequence counter is global.
    - **[V]** The default target `2.255.255.255` misses typical 192.168.x LANs, so the first run gives a dark rig.
    - No sACN Stream_Terminated packets or universe discovery, no ArtSync, and every universe is re-sent at 40 Hz even when unchanged.

### A5. Fixture model (blocks pixel strips)
18. **[V] One colour per fixture.**
    - `channelMap` is flat, with `MAX_FIXTURES = 64` and 32 universes (`profiles.js`, `universes.js`).
    - GDTF import ignores geometry instances and 16-bit offsets, and mislabels warm white, cool white and amber (`gdtf.js:26,128,173`).
    - There is no DDP/WLED output and no Open Fixture Library import.

### A6. Analysis pipeline (Medium)
19. **No structure model.** Sections come from Laplacian clustering plus fixed rules (`structure.py:140-456`).
    - There is no buildup or pre-chorus label.
    - The fallback path can never produce "chorus".
    - Beatless intros and outros fall outside every section.
20. **Waste and fragility:**
    - The file is decoded four times.
    - Models are never pre-warmed at worker start (`cli.py:142`), despite what the docs say.
    - Beat This! waits on the GPU lock behind separation and MuQ.
    - A failure in either MuQ model discards both results.
    - The separation pool leaks on an exception.
    - The PANNs download can happen mid-track.
    - The device override skips setup, and a custom BS-RoFormer path is ignored.
    - Documents are several MB because the embeddings are unrounded.
21. **[V] The live analyser exists but isn't wired.** `analyze.py --live` / `StreamingAnalyzer` (`realtime.py`) has no audio capture and no Node consumer. Its reads are 4096-sample blocks (about 186 ms), while the docs claim 23 ms.
22. **Tooling:**
    - `download-models.py` never fetches `htdemucs` and does fetch the unused `skey-onnx`.
    - The interpreter probe doesn't check torch or beat_this.
    - `schema.py` is dead code.
    - The docs have drifted in about ten places.

### A7. UI / UX (Medium)
23. **Every `state` push is the full live state**, not a diff (`state.js:197`).
    - It is emitted on every `applyPatch`: about 2/s from expression events, plus every slider drag, unthrottled.
    - Nearly every component re-renders, and the DMX monitor re-diffs 512 cells each time.
    - The preview gets DMX at only 10 Hz and is DOM-based, so strobes and fast chases are invisible in the UI.
24. **Settings page** (`public/settings.js`, a separate 1563-line vanilla page):
    - The patch table and MIDI map are rebuilt on every push, wiping focus and edits mid-show.
    - Apply loses edits in other sections.
    - Raw `socket.emit` replays buffered actions after a reconnect.
    - It duplicates the API, auth and socket code.
25. **Live-use gaps:**
    - no PWA, Wake Lock or fullscreen, so a tablet can sleep mid-show;
    - 14–28 px touch targets;
    - information hidden in tooltips;
    - no big-button performance view and no 3D view;
    - dark theme only;
    - reduced-motion only partly honoured;
    - tabs without tabpanels and dialogs without a focus trap.
26. **Bugs:**
    - Space tap-tempo is swallowed after a click (`CommandBar.jsx:22`).
    - Previews ignore energy effects (`utils.js:44`).
    - Rehearsal resets on a view switch (`StagePreview.jsx:62`).
    - The auto-start flag is lost on a tab switch (`AutoMode.jsx:137`).
    - Analysis can't be cancelled, and failures never reach the UI.
    - Sliders snap back mid-drag.
    - Cue overwrite has no undo, and show-file load has no confirm.
    - README promises (BPM entry, 1/16 division) aren't in the UI.
    - Fixture numbering differs between pages.
    - The 641 KB source map is public, and there is no compression.
    - The extension options still say `LIGHTSHOW_TOKEN`.

## Part B — Target architecture ("v2")

```
 sources ─┐  Spotify(+SMTC) · alphatheta-connect (beats, PSSI, NFS audio, 2 decks) · live input (WASAPI/line-in) · tap/Link
          ▼
   Conductor (musical clock): posMs, beat, beatFrac, bar, float BPM  ◄── analysed / rekordbox beat grid
          ▼
   Director (per track + set memory) ──► Timeline (intents)  ──►  frame-accurate scheduler
          ▼
   Engine worker_thread @44 Hz: looks = pure f(musical time, fixture geometry) → cells (pars, pixels)
          ▼
   Outputs with per-output latency: Art-Net (seq/ArtSync) · sACN (term/discovery) · Hue · DDP→WLED
          ▼
   Binary frames ──► SPA (Perform / Show / Stage 3D / Rig / Sources / Settings), PWA
```

**Key decisions**
- **TypeScript**, migrated incrementally (`allowJs`), on Node 24 LTS.
- **Preact + signals kept.** They are small and already fit; TypeScript is added and the app becomes one SPA.
- **Engine in a `worker_thread`**, not a Rust sidecar.
- **Patterns become pure functions of musical time** rather than mutating `_step`, which makes preview parity exact and makes reseeks harmless.

---

## Part C — Phased roadmap

Every phase is its own PR, keeps `npm run check` and the Python suite green, and adds tests for what it changes.

### Phase 0 — Safety & broken integrations (first PR)
**Security**
- Harden the HTTP and Socket.IO boundary and settings validation (details in the private audit notes, see A1).
- Stricter handling of analysis sources, uploads and GDTF imports; escape the OAuth callback page; bound the
  in-memory OAuth state map.

**Crash safety**
- `process.on('uncaughtException'|'unhandledRejection')`: log and keep the rig running.
- try/catch around `renderDmx`, `_tick` and the integration timers.
- `analyzer-worker.js`:
  - handlers bound to their own process (`if (proc !== this._proc) return`);
  - a stdin `error` listener;
  - an unparsable line while a request is pending fails that request instead of hanging it.
- Python: run `json_safe` after the embeddings and S-KEY are added, and `json.dumps(allow_nan=False)` in `cli.py`.

**External breakage**
- `src/spotify.js`:
  - the playlist `/items` endpoint and field renames;
  - an **ISRC resolver** in `src/isrc.js`: Deezer public search `artist:"…" track:"…"` → duration within ±2 s → `/track/{id}.isrc`, cached, with MusicBrainz as the fallback. Deezer's `/track/isrc:X` is undocumented and returns a single track, so verify against a live account.
  - The README drops "anyone's playlist".
- yt-dlp: add `--js-runtimes node:<process.execPath>`. Preflight checks the yt-dlp version (≥2025.11.12) and the runtime.
- Unique download temp names (`crypto.randomUUID` inside a `mkdtemp` dir) in `auto-show.js` and `deezer.js`.

**Timing bugs**
- `prolink.js`:
  - re-anchor only when the beat number changes;
  - scale elapsed time by pitch;
  - use `performance.now()`;
  - staleness from the master only;
  - the cache key includes the media/USB identity.
- `hybrid-source.js`: keep the last position on a driver switch instead of dropping to 0.
- All non-hybrid sources run through `PlaybackClock`. Each sample is timed at the midpoint of the request's round trip. Spotify's `timestamp` field is not used, because it marks the last playback-state change, not when the position was sampled.

**Stalls**
- Analysis cache:
  - async reads;
  - a temp-then-rename write;
  - an `index.json` for `list()`;
  - LRU eviction by size;
  - the key includes the separator and model ids.
- The preflight download uses async `spawn` with a timeout.
- The sync-offset save is debounced.

### Phase 1 — Musical clock & beat-locked rendering (the foundation of "smarter")
- **New `src/show/clock.js` (Conductor).** It turns a position source plus a beat grid (analysed, rekordbox, or live) into `{posMs, beatIndex, beatFrac, barIndex, bpm}`, with float BPM and interpolation between beats. In manual mode the Conductor free-runs from tap tempo, BPM entry or MIDI.
- **Patterns derive everything from musical time.**
  - `step = floor((beatIndex + beatFrac) × division)`; fade/hit/ribbon/ensemble phases come from `beatFrac`/`barFrac`.
  - Delete `restartBeatTimer` and `_step` from `engine.js`/`patch.js`.
  - Change `src/shared/patterns.js` and `look-math.js` to accept `t`.
- **Float BPM** in `validation.js`, `render.js`/`director.js` `clampBpm` and `integrations.js:214`.
- **Frame-accurate scheduler.** Each frame fires the timeline events in `(prevPos, pos]`, replacing the 20 ms `_tick` interval in `auto-show.js`.
- **Per-output latency.** Generalise the Hue delay line in `output.js` so every output lands at the same moment.
- **`preview.js` samples the same Conductor**, so rehearsal is exact.
- **Tests:**
  - chase steps land within one frame of the analysed beats across a whole fixture track at a non-integer BPM;
  - no drift;
  - a reseek does not reset the phase.

### Phase 2 — Engine v2: TypeScript, worker thread, pixels, outputs

> **Status.**
> - **2a (#44, merged):** LED bars, meaning cells, geometry, the pixel effects, GDTF cells and 16-bit/virtual channels,
>   and the bar maker.
> - **2b (#45, merged):** the worker-thread engine at 44 Hz on a drift-corrected clock, with a main-thread fallback.
>   On the output side:
>   - Art-Net: per-universe sequence, ArtSync, and ArtPoll discovery with unicast routing.
>   - sACN: termination, discovery and interface choice.
>   - 16-bit dimming, plus a software strobe for fixtures with no strobe channel.
> - **2c (#46, merged):** the whole server as strict TypeScript on ES modules, run by Node's own type stripping
>   (Node 22.18+, no build step), and the analysis document described once in a JSON Schema that the Python tests
>   validate against and the TypeScript types are generated from.
> - **2c, OFL import:** Open Fixture Library fixtures, from a downloaded file or searched for online. Matrix modes
>   import as bars in the order their pixels sit, groups of pixels as cells, a strobe only where it behaves as the
>   show's does. Profiles gained `defaults`, so a channel the show does not drive is not left closed at 0.
> - **Deliberately dropped:**
>   - **Temporal dithering:** at 44 Hz it flickers visibly at the low levels it is meant to smooth.
>   - **Send-on-change with keep-alive:** nodes that time out would blink, and unicast routing already takes the load
>     off the network.
> - **2d:** strips longer than a universe run on into the next ones (whole pixels to each, from channel 1); panels
>   (profiles with a grid, drawn as rectangles on the stage plot, sampled in two dimensions); WLED found over mDNS,
>   added in a click from its `/json/info`, and sent DDP; caps raised against a measured budget to 4,096 cells,
>   1,024 to a fixture and 64 universes.
- **TypeScript**, starting with `src/shared`, `src/show` and `src/server`.
- **Analysis-document types** generated from a Python JSON Schema, which replaces the dead `schema.py`.
- **`worker_threads` engine** owning the Conductor, rendering and outputs, at 44 Hz with a drift-corrected timer.
  - The main thread posts patches.
  - Frames are shared through a `SharedArrayBuffer` for the monitor and preview.
- **Fixture model v2:**
  - profiles gain `cells[]`, each with emitters and optional 16-bit;
  - fixtures gain `geometry` (point / line of N pixels / matrix) in stage coordinates;
  - strips that span universes are handled automatically;
  - the caps are raised against a measured per-frame budget.
- **Looks render into a continuous field** sampled at every cell, so four pars and 600 pixels share one effect.
  - Port the 18 patterns.
  - Add pixel-native effects: gradient sweep, comet, centre-out burst, mirror, noise/plasma, bass/vocal VU and onset sparkles.
- **Outputs:**
  - **Art-Net:** per-universe sequence, ArtSync, ArtPoll first-run discovery with unicast.
  - **sACN:** stream termination, universe discovery, interface choice.
  - **16-bit dimmer** plus temporal dithering for 8-bit fixtures.
  - **DDP → WLED:** UDP 4048, up to 480 RGB px per packet, `_wled._tcp` mDNS discovery.
- **Imports:** GDTF geometry, 16-bit and amber/WW/CW fixes, plus **Open Fixture Library** JSON import.
- Cues, palettes and energy effects carry over through an adapter.

### Phase 3 — Sources v2: CDJs, Spotify, live input

> **Status (#49).**
> - **CDJs:**
>   - alphatheta-connect 0.27.0 is pinned, with npm overrides pointing its `file:` dependencies at the registry.
>   - Beat and absolute-position packets are read on our own socket: the library parses beat packets as positions.
>   - The show follows the deck on air, not only the master.
>   - The exact file is fetched over NFS and cached apart from search results.
>   - rekordbox's grid and PSSI phrases become the beats and sections.
>   - The show crossfades between decks, with the outgoing show playing on its own deck until the incoming track
>     is ready.
>   - Fader levels are left out: the DJM only reports them to a device posing as Stagehand, and on-air carries the
>     same decision.
> - **Live input:**
>   - soundcard capture (WASAPI loopback, Linux monitors) or a line-in, at a 256-sample hop.
>   - The live beat tracker now re-fits its phase to the last 4 s of onsets instead of nudging on every onset:
>     that nudging let hats and snares walk the grid off the music.
>   - Auto-sync by cross-correlating the live onsets with the analysed ones.
>   - A live director for music with no analysis.
>   - MIDI clock out.
> - **Not done:**
>   - The neural online tracker (BeatNet+/BEAST): the fixed PLL is within 10 ms on the test material, so it can wait
>     for a real need.
>   - Ableton Link: MIDI clock covers the same software through a loopback port, with nothing native to build.
- **Replace `prolink-connect` with `alphatheta-connect`:**
  - beat packets drive the Conductor (true phase lock), with 30 ms absolute position on CDJ-3000;
  - the rekordbox grid becomes the beat grid;
  - **PSSI phrases** map to section roles (Intro/Up/Down/Chorus/Bridge/Verse/Outro → intro/buildup/breakdown/chorus/…);
  - the **exact audio is fetched over NFS**, so no yt-dlp;
  - on-air/fader state for two decks crossfades the show between the tracks during a mix.
- **Live input service** (Python, `sounddevice`):
  - Capture from **WASAPI loopback** on the show PC (exactly what Spotify plays) or from a line-in off the booth output.
  - `StreamingAnalyzer` reads hop-sized blocks, which fixes the 186 ms latency.
  - An optional neural online tracker (BeatNet+ or BEAST).
  - It streams beat phase, onsets and band energy at about 100 Hz to Node over a local socket.
- **Auto-sync (known track).** Continuously cross-correlate the live onset/energy envelope with the analysed track's envelope, and feed the measured offset into the Conductor. This replaces the manual sync offset and cancels Spotify's position error.
- **Unknown track or no pre-analysis.** The Conductor runs on live beats, and a reactive "live director" uses the realtime events: drops on the rise, buildups, silence.
- **Optional:** Ableton Link (`@ktamas77/abletonlink`) in and out, and MIDI clock out.

### Phase 4 — Analysis v2

> **Status.**
> - **Structure:**
>   - SongFormer names the sections: its functions become the roles, with a new `prechorus` role, and its boundaries
>     are snapped to the bar line.
>   - The self-similarity clusters still decide which sections are the same music.
>   - A detected drop turns a chorus or an instrumental into a `drop`: SongFormer has no drop label. It does not
>     overrule a verse; on real music that turned correctly named verses into drops. Instrumentals keep a new
>     `instrumental` role.
>   - Scored against human annotations of ten SALAMI live recordings (`scripts/eval-structure.py`): section names
>     match over 68 % of the track (SongFormer alone 69 %, the labeller 33 %, "verse" everywhere 30 %), and
>     boundaries within 3 s at 0.71 F against the labeller's 0.56.
>   - The Laplacian labeller is the fallback. Its sections now reach the ends of the track.
> - **SongFormer's cost:**
>   - Measured on a 4-core CPU: 0.75× the track's length.
>   - Its attention is quadratic in the window it reads: a five-minute track read whole was killed for memory on a
>     16 GB machine. The window is now sized to the free memory, and too little falls back to the labeller.
>   - So `auto` runs it only on a GPU, and Settings → Structure can force it on or off.
>   - `bench-analyze.py --structure songformer` is the 890M benchmark still to run.
> - **Not done:**
>   - EDMFormer has no released weights.
>   - The five fixture tracks carry no audio, so the real-music score comes from SALAMI's live recordings instead:
>     not studio pop, and not club tracks.
> - **A6:** all fixed.
>   - One decode per track.
>   - Beat This! is warmed first at worker start and runs first on the GPU.
>   - MuLan and the embeddings fail independently.
>   - Every pool is shut down in `finally`.
>   - The device override gets the same set-up as auto-detection.
>   - The BS-RoFormer path is honoured.
>   - The analysis never downloads the tagger.
>   - Embeddings are rounded to four places.
>   - `--live` reads a hop at a time.
> - **Pixels:**
>   - A `pulse` block holds the stem envelopes at 50 Hz and the kick, snare and hat lanes from the drum stem.
>   - The engine samples it every frame for the `drums` and `stems` bar patterns, and `meter`.
> - **Environment:**
>   - `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` pin torch, torchaudio and torchvision to one index per build (cpu, cu128,
>     rocm7.2), and the server prefers the `.venv` this makes.
>   - A registry-driven `download-models.py` feeds Settings → Analysis models, with progress.
>   - The preflight imports the torch stack for real.
>   - Schema 2.1.
>   - Per-stage timings in `meta.timings` and `bench-analyze.py`.

- **Structure models:**
  - **SongFormer** for pop/rock (intro/verse/pre-chorus/chorus/bridge/inst/outro/silence);
  - **EDMFormer** for EDM (intro/buildup/drop/breakdown/outro/silence);
  - both need the **MuQ** backbone, which is already downloaded, plus MusicFM, which is new; the model is chosen from the perception genre, or both are run and fused;
  - the speed on the Radeon 890M is benchmarked before either is adopted;
  - the Laplacian labeller stays as the fallback;
  - scored against the five committed fixture tracks.
- **Fix A6:**
  - decode once at 44.1 kHz and resample;
  - warm the models at worker start, with Beat This! first;
  - isolate MuQ failures;
  - shut the pool down in `finally`;
  - device override and BS-RoFormer path;
  - fetch the tagger outside the analysis path;
  - round the embeddings.
- **For pixels:** 50 Hz per-stem envelopes and kick/snare/hat onset lanes from the drum stem.
- **Environment:**
  - a **uv**-managed Python environment with a lockfile and per-platform torch indexes (CUDA/ROCm/CPU);
  - an in-UI model manager with progress;
  - fix `download-models.py`;
  - a stronger interpreter probe;
  - a schema version bump;
  - per-stage timings in `bench-analyze.py`.

### Phase 5 — Director v2 (smarter show)

> **Status.**
> - **Drum lanes, measured first.** `scripts/eval-drums.py` scores the kick, snare and hat lanes against MDB Drums:
>   23 real recordings, hits marked by hand. The phase 4 rules, tuned on a synthetic kit, scored F 0.78 / 0.59 / 0.47
>   on the Demucs stem. Retuned on MIREX 2017's training half, they score 0.88 / 0.71 / 0.50 on the other half.
>   `pulse.detector` (schema 2.2) says which rules found a track's hits.
> - **Pars and bars.** A scene can give the bars a `pixelPattern` of their own while the pars run `pattern`.
>   On a rig with bars the pars carry a wash and the bars the role's picture:
>   - verse: gradient
>   - pre-chorus and build-up: the new `rise`, one fill across the build's scenes
>   - chorus: comet, mirrored
>   - drop: the new `impact`, with sparks on the kick
>   - breakdown: plasma
>   - bridge: drums
>
>   A rig of pars at first was byte for byte unchanged; then it got its own improvements:
>   - chorus and drop looks mirrored about the centre (a chase runs from the middle out to both ends);
>   - build-ups that stack out from the middle;
>   - a long passage's look returning at the top of every phrase, where two looks used to alternate for the whole
>     section;
>   - `hit` flashing on the trusted kick (and stem snare) instead of the grid alone;
>   - gradient, plasma, comet, burst — and drums, on trusted lanes — in its pools;
>   - `stack-up` filling in N steps, on the bar, rather than N + 1.
>
>   The pars golden hashes were updated on purpose for it, with the reasons in `pars-golden.test.js`.
> - **Accents on real drum hits:** snapped to the strong kick or snare within 80 ms, none on an empty bar line, one
>   on a fill's last hit. Only lanes found by the new rules count, and snares only from the stem.
> - **Set memory:**
>   - no palette bank or section look twice in a row;
>   - on a Camelot mix, shared colours carry over;
>   - a peak, a breather or the warm-up scales the accent budget and the stride;
>   - blinders rationed.
> - **DJ transitions:** a CDJ blend runs to the incoming drop, or to its next phrase within 10 s. A cut is a cut,
>   and a track brought in hot gets one bar.
> - **Flash limit:** 3 large-area flashes a second (WCAG 2.3.1), measured over the whole rig in the renderer. Strobes
>   are capped at 3 Hz. Off by default.
> - **Track edits:** a locked palette, section looks and accents added or removed. Stored beside the cache entry,
>   applied last on every plan, edited from the auto mode panel or `PUT /api/auto/overlay`.
> - **Not done:**
>   - The SeqLight/Skip-BART research track.
>   - The flash limit's rehearsal-preview counterpart: the preview does not simulate strobes at all.
>   - Four of the five fixture analyses are older ones with uncertain downbeats (confidence 0.05–0.25). The contrast
>     pass spends no bar accents on them, before this phase and after. Tracks analysed with the drum lanes get
>     their accents from the hits instead.

- **Pixel-aware looks by role.** Pars carry the colour and wash; strips carry motion and detail.
  - verse: slow gradient
  - pre-chorus/buildup: rising fill
  - chorus: mirrored chase
  - drop: centre-out burst plus kick sparkles
  - breakdown: low plasma
- **Accents on real drum onsets**, not on the bar grid alone.
- **Set memory:**
  - no repeated palette or look back to back;
  - an energy arc across the night;
  - harmonic-key palette continuity.
- **DJ transitions** from the Phase 3 two-deck data.
- **Photosensitivity limiter** (≤3 large-area flashes/s), which can be toggled.
- **Per-track show overlays.** Operator edits (lock palette, swap a section's look, add or remove accents) are stored with the cache entry and re-applied on every replan.
- **Research track, optional.** A/B the SeqLight/Skip-BART learned hue/intensity prior against the rule director. Adopt it only if it wins a blind test.

### Phase 6 — UI v2

> **Status.** Done, delivered in three parts: 6a, 6b and 6c. **6a — the live surface — done:**
> - **Protocol v2:**
>   - an opt-in handshake gives the live page a snapshot, then per-domain versioned key diffs, resynced on a gap;
>   - binary DMX frames go out at 30 Hz, volatile, only to subscribed sockets;
>   - the page holds one signal per key, and faders keep drafts sent once per animation frame;
>   - protocol 1 is unchanged for Companion (and, until 6b, the settings page).
> - **Perform view:** pads for blackout and the six energy effects (held or latched), tap, palettes, master and intensity
>   faders, now/next and sync-health chips; `/#perform` bookmarks it.
> - **PWA:** a manifest, icons and a network-first app-shell service worker; wake lock via nosleep.js (the Wake Lock API
>   where it is allowed, a muted video on plain HTTP); fullscreen.
> - **Accessibility:**
>   - an ARIA tab strip with tabpanels, landmarks, labels, a skip link and dialog focus traps;
>   - 44 px touch targets and whole-page reduced motion;
>   - dark, light and red-night themes;
>   - axe-core reports no violations on any view in any theme.
> - **A7.26:** every item fixed or confirmed (previews already honoured energy effects).
> - **Tests:** Playwright e2e in CI (desktop and touch tablet), component tests rendered in Node.
>
> **6b — setting up — done:**
> - **One SPA:** the settings page is gone (`public/settings.js`, `settings.css`); `/settings.html` redirects its old
>   tabs to the **Rig** (plan & patch, profiles, outputs), **Sources**, **Settings** and **Preflight** views (keys
>   4–7 then, 6–9 since 6c), one spec-driven section per group of stored settings.
> - **Pixel mapping:** the Rig view's plan — select, marquee, drag, snap, row and end-to-end arranging, an inspector —
>   and *Draw bar*: the bar lights on the rig (first cell green, last red, a dot between) and is drawn from end to
>   end on the plan, then the next bar is lit.
> - **Identify:** fixtures and universes flash through the renderer (over the look, through the master and a
>   blackout); Art-Net nodes get ArtAddress *locate*; an unpatched WLED is streamed the picture over DDP; a Hue
>   channel through its fixture or the bridge's identify.
> - **Discovery:** Art-Net nodes, other sACN sources (universe discovery) and universes they share with the rig,
>   WLEDs, Hue bridges; `POST /api/fixtures` adds a run of one profile.
> - **Onboarding wizard:** outputs, fixtures, placement, music, pre-show check; offered on a fresh install
>   (`setup.completed`), again from Settings.
> - **Tests:** e2e for the views, the plan, identify, settings and secrets, the wizard; axe on every new view and
>   wizard step in every theme.
>
> **6c — the show and the stage — done:**
> - **Timeline view** (the planned *Show* view, key 4): the loaded track's timeline, zoomable to 8× and a scrubber —
>   press, drag or arrow keys to rehearse from any moment, section buttons to jump — with the stage preview, the
>   analysis and the track edits (an accent goes in at the rehearsal mark while rehearsing).
> - **Stage view** (key 5): three.js, instanced — par heads with haze cones and floor pools, bar and panel cells,
>   Hue bulbs, trusses where the rig hangs — from the audience, above or the side, with a haze setting and orbit,
>   touch and keyboard controls. Live from the DMX feed through each profile; rehearsing, the planned show sampled
>   by `shared/preview.ts` every frame, one rehearsal position shared with the Timeline view.
> - **Build:** the bundle is an ES module split by esbuild; three.js is a lazy chunk, listed for the service worker
>   to keep. A browser without WebGL is told so.
> - **Tests:** the room layout and light colours (unit); scrubbing, rehearsal, blackout, viewpoints, no-WebGL and
>   the kept chunks (e2e, on an analysed track the e2e server seeds its throwaway cache with, `LIGHTSHOW_CACHE_DIR`);
>   axe on both views in every theme.
- **One SPA.** Settings move into `public-src`, and `public/settings.js` and its duplicate API/auth/socket code are deleted.
- **Protocol v2:**
  - domain-scoped signals with versioned diffs;
  - binary preview frames at 30 Hz, volatile, sent only to subscribed rooms;
  - slider emits throttled to one per animation frame, with local drafts.
- **Views:**
  - **Perform:** tablet-first pads for blackout, kill, blinder, strobe, UV and palettes, plus intensity, now/next and sync health.
  - **Show:** timeline, analysis and the overlay editor.
  - **Stage:** a **three.js** 3D view with volumetric par cones, emissive pixel strips and haze, rendered from the shared engine code at 60 fps with scrubbable rehearsal.
  - **Rig:** the patch plus pixel mapping (draw strips on the plan) and Art-Net/sACN/WLED/Hue discovery with an identify flash.
  - **Sources**, **Settings** and **Preflight**.
- **PWA:** manifest, service-worker app shell, Wake Lock and fullscreen.
- **Accessibility and touch:**
  - ≥44 px targets;
  - tabpanels and dialog focus traps;
  - labels and contrast;
  - full reduced-motion support;
  - light and red-night themes;
  - a first-run onboarding wizard.
- **Fix every bug in A7.26.**
- **Tests:** Playwright e2e smoke tests (Chromium is preinstalled) and component tests.

### Phase 7 — Platform & ops (interleaved)

> **Status: done**, in three parts — **7a** (upgrades and refactors), **7b** (logging, health, the supervisor,
> Deezer as a plugin) and **7c** (packaging). **7a — done:**
> - **Upgrades:** Node 24 LTS in CI and `.nvmrc` (the unit job also runs on 22.18, the oldest Node that works);
>   zod 4, @preact/signals 2, eslint 10 (with `@eslint/js`), esbuild 0.28; dotenv replaced by Node's own
>   `process.loadEnvFile` (`src/load-env.ts`). The director's golden now hashes the plan to ten digits: V8's
>   `Math.pow` moved by one ulp between Node 22 and 24, and the plan itself did not change.
> - **Refactors:** `routes.ts` (101 routes) and `rig-routes.ts` are a module per domain in `src/server/routes/`, the 107 routes
>   registering as before; settings, show, cues and the MIDI map share `JsonStore` (read, validate, move a bad
>   file aside, write atomically); one `isLoopback` (`src/server/loopback.ts`) replaces four.
>
> **7b — done:**
> - **Logging:** pino (`src/server/log.ts`) — readable lines on a terminal, JSON otherwise, a rotating
>   `logs/lightshow.log` (10 MB, three kept) and a ring buffer of the last thousand entries, which is where
>   the tail of the run before a restart is read back into. The existing `[tag]` console lines are routed
>   through it with the tag as the component, so nothing had to be rewritten to get levels and components.
>   The drawer's **Log** tab polls `GET /api/logs`, filters by level and text, and marks the run before.
> - **Health:** `GET /api/health` — `ok` / `degraded` / `failing`, with the problems in words (the engine
>   down or fallen back, late frames, main-thread stalls from `monitorEventLoopDelay`, memory, recent
>   errors, the auto show, restarts) — and `GET /healthz` for a service manager.
> - **Supervision:** `npm start` runs the server as the child of a small supervisor
>   (`src/supervisor.ts`) that starts it again after a crash or when its heartbeat stops for 15 s,
>   backing off from half a second to ten, giving up on a server that never starts, and never restarting
>   one whose configuration will not let it (exit 78). The look on stage is kept in `config/look.json`
>   and put back before the new run's first frame, the auto show reloaded from the cache — never an
>   energy effect. Settings waiting on a restart get a banner and a **Restart now** button (exit 75).
>   Tested for real in `tests/e2e/supervisor.spec.js`: SIGKILL mid-look, the look comes back.
> - **Deezer:** d-fi-core is an optional dependency imported the first time Deezer is used;
>   `--openssl-legacy-provider` is no longer on by default — the supervisor passes it only when an ARL is
>   set, and a first ARL is reported as waiting on a restart. The terms-of-service risk is said where the
>   ARL is entered and in the README.
>
> **7c — done:**
> - **The packaged build** (`npm run package`): Node 24 as a single executable application whose script
>   (`scripts/sea-main.cjs`) picks the data folder and imports the app beside it — not bundled: the `app`
>   folder is the same files a checkout runs, type-stripped by Node, with the production `node_modules`.
>   Checked first that `import()`, worker threads from `.ts` and fork with IPC all work inside a SEA. The
>   Windows executable carries the app's icon and name (resedit, after postject). Portable zip (data beside
>   it), Windows installer (Inno Setup, per user, data in `%LOCALAPPDATA%`), Linux archive. CI builds each on
>   its own platform, smoke-tests it (`scripts/smoke-package.js`), and installs, runs and uninstalls the
>   installer; a version tag drafts a release.
> - **The uv bootstrap:** Sources → Analysis environment runs `uv sync --locked --extra <build> --python 3.12`
>   with uv's own Python — nothing to install first — suggesting CUDA, ROCm or the CPU build from the machine,
>   with progress, cancel, and the analyser paused (and the live input stopped) while it runs; the package
>   carries uv. `npm run setup:python` from a terminal.
> - **What made it possible:** everything the server writes hangs off one data directory
>   (`LIGHTSHOW_DATA_DIR`); yt-dlp, Deno (yt-dlp[deno], the runtime a SEA needs, which cannot be the Node
>   yt-dlp runs) and ffmpeg (imageio-ffmpeg) come with the environment and are found there when not on PATH;
>   the supervisor stops the server over IPC (on Windows a signal is a kill, with no blackout), a server
>   outlives no supervisor, SIGHUP (the console closed) is a clean stop, and under a SEA the legacy OpenSSL
>   provider goes through NODE_OPTIONS.
- **Upgrades:** Node 24 LTS, zod 4, @preact/signals 2, eslint 10, esbuild 0.28; drop dotenv.
- **Refactors:**
  - split `routes.js` (87 routes) into domain routers;
  - a shared JSON-store base class to replace four copies;
  - one loopback helper.
- **Logging:** pino structured logs with an in-UI log view, and a health endpoint.
- **Supervision:** a crash supervisor that restores the look after a restart.
- **Deezer (d-fi-core):** lazy-loaded as an optional plugin, only when an ARL is set. Terms-of-service risk is noted, and `--openssl-legacy-provider` is removed from the default start.
- **Packaging:** a Windows portable/installer build (Node SEA) plus a uv bootstrap.

### Phase 8 — From the operator's list

> **8 — done:** six things met at a real rig.
> - **MIDI faders that jump to 0 or 100 %.** A motorised fader's touch sensor sends a CC of its own, 127 on
>   touch and 0 on release, and learn took it for the fader.
>   - Learning a fader now waits for a value between the ends.
>   - A fader bound to a control that only ever sends 0 and 127 is ignored, with one warning.
>   - A map that bound the sensor moves the binding to the fader's own CC the first time both are seen,
>     and saves it.
>   - The motor leaves a fader alone while it is touched.
> - **Hue lamps with no DMX address.** A fixture can be `output: { protocol: 'hue' }`.
>   - The server places it on universes of its own (from 60000) that are rendered and read back but never
>     sent.
>   - A Hue lamp profile is one by default. Shows saved with Hue lamps on DMX are taken off it on load.
>   - "Patch a lamp" on a Hue channel adds one and binds it.
> - **CUDA out of memory on an 8 GB card.** On a card under 12 GB the analysis models wait in pinned RAM
>   and go onto the card for their own pass only. The card's copy is dropped after the pass, never copied
>   back or reloaded from disk.
>   - A pass that still runs out of memory is run again on the CPU. A card that kept models resident keeps
>     them in RAM from then on.
>   - Settings → Analysis → GPU memory overrides the choice.
> - **Now playing on Linux.** The MPRIS players on the session bus are read through systemd's `busctl`,
>   into the same snapshots as the Windows media session.
> - **WLED.**
>   - A fixture may have 4,096 cells, so a 64 × 32 matrix is one panel. WLED profiles are compact.
>   - "Add each segment" makes each WLED segment a fixture, sent to its own LEDs over DDP (row by row for
>     a rectangle of a panel), all of one WLED in one frame.
>   - Three effects after LedFx's: Bars (a spectrum analyser), Fire and Rain. They stand up on a panel.
>   - On a rig with panels the auto show gives them a layer of their own (`panelPattern`): the band's
>     levels while it plays and builds, fire in a chorus or a drop, rain where it rests. The pars and
>     the bars keep their looks.
> - **Companion for busking.**
>   - Protocol 2, and the server's own catalogues.
>   - Palettes, the bars' pattern, momentary holds kept alive while pressed, cues, the auto show, tempo
>     ×2/÷2.
>   - A Busk preset page.

## Part E — Delivery & verification

**Order of work.** Phase 0 first, as one PR. Each later phase is its own PR, started after the previous one is
reviewed. Phase 7 items are interleaved wherever they unblock something.

**Verification for every phase:**
- `npm run check` (lint plus 620+ unit tests) and `npm run build:client`.
- CI's Python job (`python -m unittest discover -s tests/python`).

**Phase 0 specifics:**
- **Security:** unit tests for every hardened boundary (see the private notes).
- **Worker:** tests for the double-recycle race, the EPIPE path and a response line containing NaN.
- **Spotify:** tests using recorded `/items` payloads, plus the ISRC resolver with a mocked Deezer API.
- **yt-dlp:** a test that the args include `--js-runtimes`.
- **PRO DJ LINK:** a test that position is monotonic under 5 Hz status packets and scales with pitch.
- **Prefetch:** unique temp names under concurrent prefetch.
- **Smoke run:** start the server (`npm start`), check with curl that `/api/state` works, and exercise the hardened boundary.

**Phase 1:**
- Beat-alignment tests on `tests/fixtures/tracks/*.json` (steps within one 25 ms frame of the analysed beats at non-integer BPM).
- Preview-parity tests extended to use the Conductor.

**Phases 2–6:**
- Frame-budget benchmark: 600 pixels + 8 pars in under 2 ms per frame in the worker.
- Packet-level tests for the DDP, ArtSync and sACN termination packets.
- Playwright screenshots of the Perform, Stage and Rig views on a tablet viewport.
- Structure-model accuracy against the heuristic on the committed tracks.
