# ArtNet Lightshow

Controls the [ArtNet Lightshow](https://github.com/LightD31/artnet-lightshow) server — a beat-synced light show for DMX fixtures, LED bars, WLED strips and panels and Philips Hue lamps — from a Stream Deck or any Companion surface. Built for busking: palettes, patterns and pixel effects a press away, effects that last as long as a button is held, cues, tempo and the auto show.

## Configuration

| Setting      | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Host         | Hostname or IP of the machine running the lightshow server                                  |
| Port         | Port of the lightshow server (default `3000`)                                               |
| Access token | The server's access token, when it has one (it must whenever it is reachable from the network) |

The connection shows **OK** once connected and reconnects on its own. It follows the server by its changes alone (protocol 2), so a big rig — a WLED panel of thousands of pixels — costs Companion nothing between changes.

The patterns, colours, palettes, energy effects, fixtures and cues offered in actions, feedbacks and presets are the server's own, read when it connects: a pattern or a cue added on the server shows up here without a new module.

## Busking

The **Busk** preset page has what a set played by hand needs:

- **Palettes** — every palette on the server, each button in its first colour, lit while it is the look's palette.
- **Hold** — each energy effect (white strobe, colour strobe, blinder, UV wash, kill, glow) and a blackout, **on only while the button is held**. The server lets go of a held effect on its own a second after it last heard from Companion, so a crash or a dropped network with a button down never leaves the rig strobing. The two strobes wait for the photosensitivity acknowledgement on the server: until it is given, a press (held or latched) is refused and the module's log says why.
- **Tempo** — tap, the BPM, double and halve, ±5.
- **Auto show** — start or stop it, its intensity (±10 and a display), a sync nudge (±20 ms) and the track playing.
- **Master** — the master level (±10 % and a display) and blackout.
- **Cues** — one button for each cue saved on the server.

## Variables

`bpm` (to a tenth), `clock_source` (Auto, CDJ, Track or Tap), `beat_division`, `playing`, `outputs_armed`, `pattern`, `pattern_id`, `pixel_pattern`, `panel_pattern`, `pixel_map`, `palette`, `color_a` … `color_d`, `master_dimmer`, `master_dimmer_pct`, `master_blackout`, `strobe_function`, `strobe_speed`, `energy_override`, `auto_show`, `auto_source`, `auto_intensity`, `sync_offset`, `track` (Artist — Title), `cue_count`

## Presets

Besides **Busk**: every pattern (the whole-rig ones and the pixel effects apart), the bars' and the panels' own pictures and the pixel map; all four colour slots; transport (the outputs' arming switch, play/stop, blackout, tap tempo, BPM, beat divisions); **Sequence** transport and tempo; a blackout for each fixture in the patch; and latched energy effects.

Load or edit the sequence in the lightshow's Sequence page first. **Sequence: Play / Resume** starts after a stop and resumes after a pause. Pause freezes the transport while its clips keep running; Stop holds the last picture. The optional stop-with-black action blacks only the sequence base, so live voices can still appear above it. These controls never arm outputs. Server refusals, including no loaded sequence or a missing photosensitivity acknowledgement, appear in the connection log.

The Sequence presets reuse the existing BPM display and ±5 actions. Set BPM and Adjust BPM change the shared tempo and end sequence tempo automation; later authored tempo commands can change it again. Pausing and resuming preserves the sequence position and does not reapply its initial tempo.
