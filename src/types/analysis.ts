 * What the analyser says about a track: its beat grid, its sections, its dynamics and its event
 * stream. Written by src/analysis/pipeline.py, read by the show engine. The TypeScript types in
 * src/types/analysis.ts are generated from this file (npm run gen:analysis-types);
 * src/analysis/schema.py validates the pipeline's output against it. Only the fields every 2.x
 * document carries are required at the top level: cached documents are replayed across minor
 * versions, and a field added since is simply absent from the older ones.
