"""
Offline orchestration: file in, analysis document out.

Stage order is fixed by data dependency, not by preference:

    preprocess -> features -> rhythm -> bands -> dynamics -> structure
                                  \\-> perception -> (tags feed bands' roles)
                                                  \\-> events

Two things are worth knowing about the shape of this function.

*Bands run twice.* The first pass has no beat grid, so it cannot measure
rhythmic correlation — but the rhythm stage does not need the bands. Once beats
exist, the bands are recomputed with the correlation term filled in. It costs
one extra pass over already-computed spectrograms and it is what makes the
`importance` score mean anything.

*The learned classifiers run in parallel with the DSP.* Neither needs anything
from the rest of the pipeline — the AudioSet tagger reads the file directly and
MuQ-MuLan needs only the decoded waveform — and on CPU both are several seconds.
Started as early as their input exists and collected just before the stage that
consumes them, they cost close to nothing.

The document it returns keeps every field name the previous analyser emitted,
at the top level, alongside the new structured sections. That is deliberate:
the web client, the timeline view and the cache all read those names, and a
schema change is not worth breaking them over. New consumers should read the
nested objects; the flat fields are a compatibility surface.
